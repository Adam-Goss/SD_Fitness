  'bio_title_name' => 'BIO: Sean DeVarnnes, CSCS',
  'bio_title_description' => 'Founder/Owner of SD Fitness.',
  'bio_content' => '
    <p>Sean DeVarennes is a member of the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA), and a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS).</p>
    <p>Graduating in the recent Spring of 2018 at Mercyhurst University with a bachelor’s degree in Exercise Science and minors in Public Health and Psychology, Sean has an insatiable passion to aid athletes of all ages and sports to become professionals and elite athletes and is also striving to help anyone wishing to achieve their ultimate fitness goals besides sports.</p>
    <p>Among the accomplishments of receiving his bachelor’s degree, Sean was the Head Chairmen of the Exercise Science curriculum at Mercyhurst University’s Sports Medicine department. Sean was also the Head Strength and Conditioning Coach of the ACHA DI Men’s Ice hockey program his senior year and has since fellow teammates excel in their hockey careers in college and in professional leagues.</p>
    <p> In addition to all these achievements, Sean was also the head supervisor of Mercyhurst’s Recreational training facility for 2 years in which he delegated work stations and responsibilities of maintaining and cleaning of the facility to work study students, and provided training programs, injury rehabilitation and injury prevention consultations to fellow non-athletic students and faculty members.</p>
    <p>In relation to his hockey and exercise science career, Sean has been an ice hockey player since he was 7 years old. As many Canadians living in Moncton New Brunswick, one of the many hockey hotbeds in eastern Canada, Sean wants to achieve his dreams in pursuing professional hockey in the hopes of one day, he would play in the NHL. With a burning desire to continue to improve his game day in and day out, Sean has been through countless hockey trainers in his youth and teen years, traveling around North America since he was 17, and has had unbelievable experiences not just hockey wise, but in the world of exercise science as well.</p>
    <p>During his time at Mercyhurst University, Sean played for the Mercyhurst Laker’s ACHA Division I hockey program. Along with his hockey experiences in college, Sean had amazing opportunities in observing some of North America’s best hockey trainers, including his internships with the Erie Otters of the OHL, the Division I NCAA team at Mercyhurst along with its Division II Football team, East Coast Ice Performance trainers from New Brunswick Canada, to UPMC Lemieux Ice complex, the official practice facility of the Pittsburgh Penguins.</p>
    <p>From these experiences Sean has had close mentorship from guys such as Gary Roberts, former NHL Veteran and now one of the top hockey training Guru’s of North America, in which he has his own hockey training facility in Ontario, Canada. Gary Roberts was also the co-founder of Gary Roberts High Performance Training ™, which led to Sean’s many one-on-one experiences with elite athletes ranging from U16AAA hockey players, to high level Division I NCAA athletes as well as ECHL, and AHL players. With invaluable personal experiences gained from these experiences, Sean has used every bit of knowledge from his experiences to give himself the edge to play professionally.</p>
    <p>Since graduating, Sean will be embarking his first year of Professional Ice hockey here in the United States. As he pursues his goals to become the best that he can be, he also wants to show an example not only to hockey athletes, but anyone who wants to get to the next level, whether its getting healthier, improve their performance, or reach their ultimate goals.</p>

    <p>In-season training is quite crucial in today’s fast paced hockey world. You want to keep on track with consistently performing at your best, yet sometimes it may feel like you’re “overtired”, causing some lapses in focus and ultimately causing you to underperform. Or, maybe you want to continue to improve on the small things your position on the team demands of you.</p>
    <p>I know I have. With countless years of doing in-season training, I’ve encountered these problems NUMEROUS times. This is where my In-season Elite Hockey Performance program kicks in;</p>
    <p>I have taken everything I have learned from not just learning the sport and studying the sports performance world, but from playing the sport. In fact, I am STILL using this knowledge today to propel myself higher in pro hockey, and it has given me and my clients remarkable results.</p>
    <p>Whether you are a forward, defensemen or goalie, I have the right program just for you. Unlike many hockey/sports training program nowadays, I SPECIALIZE my programs for your position, so that not only are you keeping up with your performances on a consistent basis, you are working SPECIFICALLY on your game.</p>
    <p>The Program includes;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Top programs that are backed by science and high level hockey experiences</li>
      <li>Free Weight, Machine and Bodyweight exercises</li>
      <li>Sports Specific Exercises</li>
      <li>Proper Warm-up Protocols with mobility exercises</li>
      <li>Cooldowns to ensure less soreness and more flexibility the next day</li>
      <li>Your own personalized workout schedule calendar</li>

      <li>And much more!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As I specialize in elite high performance sports training, these programs come with three volumes at one price. We all know how long a hockey season can last, therefore I devised 2 training blocks that all have volume I to Volume III.</p>

    <p>Every summer, hockey players everywhere engage in off-ice hockey training to get themselves better for the next season. Some players are looking to perform better than their previous season, some are getting ready to jump to the next level, and others are simply putting in the work to move up on their current team.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced when I grew up and trained hard for the next season, was that while I met many good trainers, A LOT of them were not making specialized training programs for me. While the training was still good (at a hefty price), much of the time I was in a group, which makes it harder to target the areas of my game that I want to improve on.</p>
    <p>Now that I am my own trainer, I have the advantage to create a program meant explicitly for my position in hockey. And I want to give you the same tools and programs that I, along with many of my other hockey clients, am using today.</p>
    <p>Whether you are a forward, defensemen or goalie, I have the right program just for you.
